Be sure to keep your arms perpendicular to your body and only extend your elbows. \n\n Pro tip: Keep your elbows in. Allowing them to flare out takes the load off the triceps. Likewise, if you let your arms move back and forth, you put a load on your shoulders, which takes away the muscle- and strength-building benefit to the triceps and can lead to injury."
